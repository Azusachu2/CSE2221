		Iftikhar: Me, Myself, and I</h1>

	<p style="color: white; font-family: Bookman Old Style; font-size: 100%">My
		name is Aisha and here's some random information about me: I was born
		in Gujrat, Pakistan and raised in Brooklyn, New York. I have an older
		brother and two younger brothers. I am currently majoring in Computer
		Science and Engineering; I've studied the C++, Java, and Python
		programming languages. My favorite thing to do is read. My absolute
		favorite books are the Harry Potter series. Other than that, I also
		loved reading the Sherlock Holmes books and Pride and Prejudice. My
		favorite tv series is definitely Game of Thrones. My favorite GoT
		characters have to be:</p>

	<ol
		style="color: white; font-family: Bookman Old Style; font-size: 100%;">
		<li>Tyrion Lannsiter</li>
		<li>Jon Snow</li>
		<li>Daenerys Targeryen</li>
		<li>Sansa Stark</li>
	</ol>

	<p style="color: white; font-family: Bookman Old Style; font-size: 100%">If
		you haven't watched Game of Thrones, I highly recommend you do, and
		here's a link to the HBO website so you can binge-watch this tv show
		before the next season starts. Though, technically you have plenty of
		time considering it doesn't come out till next summer (I think):</p>

	<p style="color: white; font-family: Bookman Old Style; font-size: 100%">I
		also like to learn languages and am multilingual. Because I have no
		idea what to put in a table, following is a table of the different
		languages I've studied/am fluent in and how long I've studied them.</p>
